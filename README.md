- 👋 Hi, I’m @Flour510 
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code through free code camp. Thinking about signing up for shecodes plus react workshop/ applying for the google apprenticeship.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a website with someone else who knows about front end development/ getting feed back on my projects on how to make them better.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is through email: preciadoflor@gmail.com
