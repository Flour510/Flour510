- 👋 Hi, I’m @Flour510 
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End development.
- 🌱 Currently self-teaching how to code through online resources such as FreeCodeCamp, Khan Academy and the Odin Project. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a website with someone else who knows about front end development/ getting feed back on my projects on how to make them better/ find a mentor.
- 📫 Best way to reach me is through email: preciadoflor@gmail.com
